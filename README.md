***Impact of COVID-19 on Emergence of Mental Health Issues in Germany – The Role of Digital Health Tracking Applications***

Impact of COVID-19 on Emergence of Mental Health Issues in Germany – The Role of Digital Health Tracking Applications.
       The COVID-19 pandemic brought unexpected and unprecedented challenges for the world and the healthcare sector of the world was at major risk in this regard. The strain that was there on the healthcare sector was undeniable and the patient load in even the developed part of the world was overwhelming. Hence, an important role was played by digital health providing services that enabled the patients to avail healthcare services at their doorstep. As per the WHO, the harnessing of health innovation and digital technologies can help in the acceleration of the attainment of the [global health stability](https://www.who.int/health-topics/digital-health#tab=tab_1).  Digital health services applies to the digital transformation of the field of healthcare including medical health applications, electronic medical records and the [electronic health records](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhealthit/definition/digital-health-digital-healthcare).

   [Research](https://www.jmir.org/2020/6/e19284/) conducted in this context reviewed deep learning methods utilized for fingerprint, face, and palm print biometric recognition. The performance of several deep learning models and conventional recognition techniques in biometrics recognition tasks is also thoroughly compared by the authors. The essay also discusses the difficulties and upcoming directions for deep learning-based biometrics recognition research. The study serves as a helpful resource for scholars and practitioners in the field by providing an overview of the current state of the art in the recognition of biometrics using deep learning techniques.
       
   Further conducted [research](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/11/6053) offered a thorough overview of the various deep learning methods employed for face, palm, and fingerprint biometric recognition. In their opening paragraph, the writers discuss the idea of biometric identification and its significance in several disciplines, such as security, forensics, and human-computer interface. The authors continue by discussing the several deep learning methods utilized in biometric recognition, such as CNNs, AEs, GANs, and RNNs. Each technique's design, advantages and disadvantages, and biometric recognition applications are all covered in detail. They draw attention to the benefits of deep learning methods, including their enhanced accuracy, robustness, and scalability as well as their capacity to manage complicated biometric data.
      
   The use of [advanced digital health technologies](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/TMJ.2020.0140) has been performed during the pandemic and a study covers the many telemedicine modalities and technologies, such as video consultations, remote monitoring, and mobile health applications that are employed in the management of chronic pain. Each technology's uses for managing chronic pain are briefly described, along with its advantages and disadvantages. The authors also go over the difficulties and constraints of using telemedicine to treat chronic pain, including the requirement for safe and dependable technology, qualified medical professionals, and payment and support from healthcare systems. A thorough overview of the future directions for telemedicine research for managing chronic pain is also provided by the authors. These directions include the creation of more sophisticated telemedicine technologies, an improvement in patient-provider communication, and the incorporation of telemedicine into current healthcare systems. 
      
  If the data relevant to the number of depression cases and the pandemic is observed, then a survey analysis was performed that helped in the collection of insights into the relationship between the pandemic and mental health cases in Germany. In the cross-sectional study, the effects of region, gender, and age were analyzed for determining the severity of the symptoms of depression via 15 minutes survey. The use of social media platforms, flyers and mailing lists was used to contact the respondents and collect insights. The [summary statistics](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.640518/full) of the analysis are given below:

  The [data analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.640518/full) contained two sample sets and there was a significant difference observed between the two due to the pandemic and its implications on the mental health disorders such as depression, compulsion, anxiety, eating disorders and others. A graphical representation of the mental health issues and their magnitude is given as follows:

  There is a minor difference between the outcome of the two samples but both of them are exposed to different dimensions of mental health issues. Hence, the pandemic brought a drastic impact on the mental health of the German population and it called for the assistance of digital health applications to combat the impact of mental health issues coupled with COVID-19.

  The telemedicine industry in Germany was accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic and it worked as a true catalyst for the uprise of the industry. Before the pandemic, the digitalization of healthcare services remained slow and the German Ministry of Health has pushed forward multiple proposals for the digitization of the healthcare system. The passing of the Digital Care Act (DVG) was one of the steps taken that helped in the improvements in telemedicine and teleconsultation in the country. The use of [digital health solutions](https://www.gtai.de/en/invest/industries/healthcare/covid-19-creating-demand-for-digital-health-applications-245222) has been found as an important resource in the management of mental burdens and physical issues resulting from home isolation. There are certain examples of the case such as [Kaia Health](https://kaiahealth.com/) (offering therapy with the help of an application using online motion and relaxation exercises) and the Berlin-based startup of mental health Selfapy that now offers specific COVID-19 treatments including guided programs and coaching. 
           
  In conclusion, the role of digital health solutions during the pandemic period has increased as people were afraid to go outside and get themselves physically checked for medical examination (due to fear of getting COVID-19). These applications and solutions provided facilities for the patients on one side and also helped the patients to manage their mental health issues in a better way. This brief study performed illustrates the impact of the pandemic on the mental illness levels of the German population and substantial evidence has been found that pandemic brought the increased levels of depression and anxiety among the different population groups of the country. Also, the findings suggest that digital health solutions can combat and mitigate the negative effect of the pandemic on the mental health conditions of the captioned population groups of the country. Therefore, resources should be channeled towards the development of such unique and innovative solutions in this regard.
