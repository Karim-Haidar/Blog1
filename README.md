# **The Future of Medical Genetics and the Importance of Digital Health**

When one talks about genetic medicine; this sounds like it is something out of science fiction. But as today, we can do a fraction of these bizarre things. Now the idea of medical genetics is that we apply [the genetic principles](https://www.ashg.org/discover-genetics/medical-genetics/#:~:text=Medical%20genetics%20is%20any%20application)  to medical practice, which includes studies of inheritance, mapping disease genes, diagnosis and treatment, and genetic counselling. But how is this tied to digital health, and could this be the future of medicine? 

## **How does this work?**

This is done by genetic engineering through the usage of a process of [recombinant DNA technology](https://youthmedicaljournal.org/2021/03/21/the-future-of-genetic-engineering/) called CRISPR by altering the genetic makeup of an organism. An example of this is the production of insulin to treat diabetes.

With a similar concept, gene therapies are performed to treat genetic disorders using [genome editing](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/genetic-therapies). It is a newer approach that allows precise correction or other targeted changes to DNA in cells to restore a cell’s function. This process allows direct modification of the cells in the body, or the cells will be collected and treated outside of the body and then returned to the body. An example of this is the treatment of cancer where the immune cells in the body are retrieved to modify the cancer cells, then they are reintroduced into the same body.

## Slight history of genetic engineering and the potential future

Here is a quick summary of the history of GT:

<img src="Figure 3.png"> **Figure 2, Figure 3 History of gene therapy , [Source:TAMURA, R., & TODA, M. (2020). Historic Overview of Genetic Engineering Technologies for Human Gene Therapy. _Neurologia Medico-Chirurgica, 60_(10), 483–491. ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7555159/)**

Why does history matter? As we have seen, genetic-related treatments are carefully monitored and legalised. Because there are potential dangers within the works of genetic manipulation as such, the creation of new diseases or an organism of complete different species.

In 2019, a scientist in China created genetically altered twins, by altering the genes of the embryos. [Vera Lucia Raposo](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6724388/#r16), a law expert in science, claims that,
> “In spite of the alleged reason for the genetic intervention related with the prevention of HIV, the scientific community also knows that the CCR5 gene is related with major brain functions. He Jiankui might have done some kind of human enhancement by created two especially intelligent human beings, with better memory and higher IQ.” 

Which begs to a list of ethical questions. Because the genetic alteration he has done is not what we are practising today, [somatic gene editing, but instead germline gene editing](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/01/perspectives-on-gene-editing/). This means it has an impact not only on the person whom he had edited, but possibly they may pass on the edited genes to their descendants.

## How is this significant and will this affect the future of medical genetics?

First, there is no real answer for this question yet. It will all depend on the outcome of He Jiankui’s “experimental twins” and the perception of the scientific community. That is to say that if the outcome is good for them, the scientific community will start changing their views on germline gene editing despite the risks. Pretty much like IVF, which people found unacceptable at first, are now accepting IVF because of its success and the increasing rate of infertility in the modern society.

Moreover, if the circumstances have led to favour the practice of germline gene editing, I believe that this could save a lot of money and resources for the government and parents. Because of the potential to prevent a child to be born with genetic diseases. 

In this video, about "Genetic Engineering Will Change Everything Forever – CRISPR" by Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell covers a variety of possibilities that genetic engineering could result in the future:

## But how does Information Technology come into play?

As of now, there are a lot of genome databases that are available. And it will only continue to grow over time. This means that more IT specialists will increase over the years. Additionally, because precision is required within this field of work due to the nature of genetics, high computational analytics will be required. And so, data scientists, especially with a background in biology would have increase in demand. Hence, the pursuit in this field of careers would be easier in the future.

With data science, analysis of genetic data are so much faster, but with the addition of the advancement of AIs, the patterns of genetic mutation and their phenotypes could be predicted with higher accuracy.

## The Obvious Challenges and How they Could be Overwhelmed

Apart from that, we have seen many countries try to push their health care into a more digital platform because of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had caused. Although digitalisation in healthcare is not widely accepted because of the lack of physical contact, the accessibility of healthcare to wider populations outweighs the lack of comfort that physical contact could provide. This has proven to be true during the COVID-19 pandemic and has pushed the advancement of digital health. As such, it could also be the same in genetic medicine.

The bigger challenges are not the challenges that are against the breakout of the norm, from the traditional medium, but within the digitalisation itself. As such, data security would be the main challenge, especially the medical records, which hold sensitive information about the patients that could potentially have their privacy breached. To prevent this, we must ensure that the data of the patients are well-encrypted and secured. This leads to the need to hire more cybersecurity specialists, and it could be costly for the paying party.

This also means that the utilisation of telemedicine will be required. For this to be successful, the government must also take part in the process to ensure that the internet connection is at optimal bandwidths for the process to be successful. Without it, the whole purpose of fast healthcare delivery could be defeated. This issue had been stated by a researcher of digital medicine in Germany, [Johanna Tecklenburg](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/medgen-2021-2057/html#j_medgen-2021-2057_ref_006_w2aab3b7c37b1b6b1ab2b1b6Aa), who had discussed the problems and the solutions to integrate digitalisation into the German healthcare system.


## Conclusion

If germline editing does get approved, ethical issues will surely rise; business institutions will try to take advantage of the new advancement by selling "designer babies" and could create genetic poverty gap. This could also lead to governments creating an army of “perfect humans”. Nevertheless, only time could tell what would happen and it will strongly depend on the people of practice.

Finally, the strong effort and support of the government, and the cooperation of all related professionals will be required if the operation is to succeed. 

The future technology of medicine is quiet powerful and it could be used in many ways. Hence, it would be greatly considered through debates and approvals before the actualisation of it. But I hope that this technology would be used for benevolence rather than for self-gain.
